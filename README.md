# Plutonium | Vulkan In C

## Disclaimer
Im coming from a C++ background but im trying my best to spread information thats helped me. That being said I do not know best practices.
I will also not be explaining build systems because I myself am terrible at them.

## Libraries
- [GLFW](https://www.glfw.org/)
- [Vulkan SDK](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/) (I will be using Vulkan 1.2. 1.3 should still work though)
 

## Creating Vulkan Objects
- [Creating Instances](https://github.com/Bryson-C/Plutonium/blob/main/Instance.md)
